Privacy policy

Google Play requires me to disclose that imgSelfie will record camera sensor, which is 
used for the purpose of taking photos.

Location permission is required for labeling the picture location, but this is disabled by default. 
If enabled, your labeling location shows in the image  (and it is only used for this purpose).

Although imgSelfie is ad-free.
